    description: "An error is a serious issue and represents the failure of something important going on in your application.  Unlike FATAL, the application itself isn‚Äôt going down the tubes.  Here you‚Äôve got something like dropped database connections or the inability to access a file or service.  This will require someone‚Äôs attention probably sooner than later, but the application can limp along.",

WARNINGS are a way of logging an indication that there might be some problems with the application, or that we are detecting a problematic situation but it's not breaking anything. Like trying to send data to some API, and after multiple failed automated attempts we put WARN to indicate it's failing to receive our data...problematic yes, app breaking no...so nothing is broken yet something is wrong. Someone should look into these, deeper investigation might show unexpected things.",

At this point we are interested in getting as much as possible data about the application behavior allowing us to detect underlying problems that may cause problems, errors, warnings, different responses. This kind of log is probably gonna hurt your application performance and as such is not intended to be used in production.
